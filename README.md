The wiki on the google code explains the thinking behind the project in more detail but in a nutshell it explores
how entities are shared between client side code (Flex and HTML) and server side code (Java JPA). The entity models
are specified in XSDs which are then compiled into POJOS using an XSD compiler. The POJOS and then converted into AS3 and 
Typescript classes using scaffolding tools.

A later version of this project can be found at code.google.com/p/ems. This will move to github when it has been upgraded.
